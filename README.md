SIM900 GSM/GPRS Shield
===================

The SIM900 is a very powerful module, which can enable an Arduino to send/receive texts, make calls, and connect to mobile internet. It is controlled using AT commands (detailed in the command reference file) sent over UART from a Serial port on the Arduino.

Like all other Shields, this module is designed to be stacked directly on top of an Arduino UNO, with pins plugging directly into the headers.
Keep in mind you will need your own SIM card, placed inside the SIM slot, before anything works!
